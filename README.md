# Predicting Animal Crossing and Doom

## Introduction

### As social media continues to grow as leading platform for communication, the style of communication is rapidly evolving. Memes are a popular form of communication on social media and often involve the combinationn of both text and images to encapsulate an idea or aspect in relation to a topic. Taken out of context, the text and images by themselves may never be enough to refer to the original idea. However, there may be trends present with the text and images paired together that refer to the original idea. Our goal is to try and predict one of two categories using a combination of trends for both image and text attributes associated with memes. We want to know:
- Can we train a model to classify a meme as Animal Crossing or Doom?
- Will the combination of Natural Language Processing and Image Recognition work together to understand topics out of context?


## Data

### We utilize a Kaggle dataset found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/doom-crossing), which is a collection of Reddit posts containing images that relate to either Animal Crossing or Doom. Both are video games, but Animal Crossing is Fun and Doom is ridiculous.
